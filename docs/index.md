# Working with Classes

## Introduction
For Assignment 08, our class was tasked with applying our knowledge of working with classes to a script that was provided to us by Professor Root. In this script, we were exposed to working with a file that had already been created and having to work within the parameters established by that script. In this document, I will discuss how I worked on this assignment and completed each section.

## Updating the File
Due to script file for Assignment 8 being one that was already made for us to use, I immediately went into the header of the file and added my information to the change log. I continued to update the header as I worked on the file, documenting the progress I made for other programmers to see.

## Preparing the Script
The first part of the script I needed to work with was setting up the classes for the data portion of the script. Classes are a methodology that allow programmers to group data and functions together. This is typically applied to environments that focus on working with processing data.

Next, I proceeded to the processing section of the script. Classes were used again in this section but were applied to the code handling the processing of the data.

Lastly, I added the script into the presentation section. This section of the script handled how the data was going to be visibly shown to the user. This included the menu of options the user needed to interact with, along with the other visible text on the screen.
